## Key Features
- **Data Processing and Cleaning:** Utilized Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis. Employed techniques such as normalization and standardization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineered new features from existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the models. Used domain knowledge and statistical methods to create relevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics, including distribution of features, identifying outliers, and exploring relationships between variables.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Processed textual data using NLP techniques, including removing stopwords, tokenization, and lemmatization, to prepare the text for analysis.
- **Feature Selection:** Employed feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, and feature importance to identify the most relevant features for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Developed and evaluated machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer recommendations. Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form for machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Utilized confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess model performance and make informed decisions.
- **Business Impact:** Addressed the business problem of improving customer satisfaction in the airline industry by developing a classification model to categorize customer reviews based on review column and other relevant factors. Provided actionable insights to airlines for enhancing the overall travel experience.
- **Communication and Visualization:** Effectively communicated insights and findings to stakeholders using data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Presented results in a clear and understandable manner to drive business decisions.
## Objective
To develop a classification model that can automatically categorize customer reviews based on relevant factors, enabling airlines to quickly identify areas of improvement, prioritize customer-centric initiatives, and enhance the overall travel experience.
